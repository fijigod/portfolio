<p>About Alanna</p>
<p>I'm a high school student at Heritage High, I enjoy doing a lot of things that require me not having to move. Normally I sit around and play video games but I soon discovered coding which is pretty interesting and complicated all at the same time.</p>
<p>I'm very hands-on with the things that I do because I feel the need to interact with pretty much everything that looks intresting.

<p>Other times I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and going to other places outside of my hometown because it does get boring from time to time. I don't really like a lot of changes unless I make them because it starts to get fustrating at a certain point espacially in coding because if there are more changes within the process of me programming, it can start to become complicated and confusing.</p>
